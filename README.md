Welcome to my GitHub -- This is where side quests turn into full-blown adventures, bugs become features (sometimes), and late-night “what if”s become real code.


I build cool stuff, break things (on purpose, mostly), and document my journey through code. Feel free to poke around, clone some chaos, or just vibe with the madness.
